/ List of challenge KPIs and how the project addressed them :

- *Addressing the Scarcity : * Aimed at reducing the scarcity of openly available, production-level codebases, the project achieved its goal by providing a suite of five versatile, open-source smart contract libraries. These libraries are readily accessible and can be used as-is or customized with additional application-specific logic.

- *Fostering Ecosystem Innovation :* The five smart contract libraries are a testament to best practices in smart contract design, testing and optimization. Designed with composability in mind, they serve as foundational blocks for building complex DApps. These libraries are ideal for teams aspiring to transition or start fresh in the Cardano ecosystem, streamlining the development process and fostering innovation within the ecosystem.

- *Ensure Code Quality and Production-Ready Resources : * The challenge was to uphold high standards of code quality, adherence to best practices, and readiness for production, aimed at alleviating the pain points faced by developers. The quality of the smart contract libraries was assessed through comprehensive methods, including code reviews, unit testing and property-based testing.

/ List of project KPIs and how the project addressed them :

- *Adoption Rate and Usage Metrics :*  The important statistics of each project's GitHub activity can be found at the following links #link("https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs/bridge-template/pulse/monthly")[bridge-template], #link("https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs/linear-vesting/pulse/monthly")[linear-vesting], #link("https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs/plutarch-merkle-tree/pulse/monthly")[plutarch-merkle-trees], #link("https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs/yieldfarming/pulse/monthly")[yield-farming], #link("https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs/single-asset-staking/pulse")[single-asset-staking]. This includes all the key repositories of this proposal which are detailed in the extensive documentation found here #link("https://anastasia-labs.github.io/production-grade-dapps")[documentation].


- *Extensive Documentation  :* Comprehensive documentation for each smart contract library, including detailed explanations of contract functionality, parameters, and usage, was provided. Detailed diagrams aid in understanding contract architecture and data flows.The document can be found #link("https://anastasia-labs.github.io/production-grade-dapps")[here].


/ Key achievements (in particular around collaboration and engagement) :

/ Key learnings :

- *Enhanced Understanding of Business Domains :* One of the key learnings was gaining a deeper insight into various business domains where these smart contract projects add significant value. This understanding allows for better alignment of technical solutions with business needs, ensuring that the developed smart contracts effectively address real-world challenges.

- *Improvements in Tooling and Documentation :* Another important learning was the recognition of the need for improved tooling and documentation. By enhancing the style and clarity of documentation, we facilitate easier onboarding for developers, making it simpler for them to understand and contribute to the projects. This improvement not only accelerates the development process but also promotes a more inclusive and collaborative environment.

/ Next steps for the product or service developed :

- *Expand with New Production-Grade DApps :* Develop and release additional high-quality DApps to enhance the ecosystem.

- *Increase Adoption :* Make these smart contracts available in various smart contract languages to reach a broader developer audience.
