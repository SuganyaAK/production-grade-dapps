/ List of challenge KPIs and how the project addressed them :

- *Addressing the Scarcity : * Aimed to reduce the scarcity of openly available, production-level codebases, the project achieved its goal by providing a suite of five versatile, open-source smart contract libraries. These libraries are readily accessible and can be adopted for general use by removing application-specific logic.

- *Fostering Ecosystem Innovation :* The five smart contract libraries are a testament to best practices in smart contract design, testing, and optimization. Designed with composability in mind, they serve as foundational blocks for building complex DApps. These libraries are ideal for teams aspiring to transition or start fresh in the Cardano ecosystem, streamlining the development process and fostering innovation within the ecosystem.

- *Ensure Code Quality and Production-Ready Resources : * The challenge was to uphold high standards of code quality, adherence to best practices, and readiness for production, aimed at alleviating the pain points faced by developers. The quality of the smart contract libraries was assessed through comprehensive methods, including code reviews, unit testing, and property-based testing.
